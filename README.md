#### Project Description

By going through Ushahidi's application process and talking to Ushahidi's mentors, we  have identified the following main problems; lack of proper data structuring, data verification, data translation and incentivization of whistleblowers. 


#### Summary

We intend to advance the application by building our solution across the Good Governance domain. We aim to incorporate the DeFi theme in Celo Blockchain with connection to Ushahidi's mission of building digital tools and running programs that give marginalized groups a voice.
We intend to improve the application in the following areas; Product design (look and feel) using Figma and other necessary design tools, technology leveraging on Web3 that is, building on top of the Celo Blockchain with the aim to improve on transparency, integrity and scalability with integration of Artificial Intelligence.
We are looking forward to implementing an impactful solution with the inspiration of giving the marginalized communities a voice.
